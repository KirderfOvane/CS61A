#| Problem 6 (Concurrency).

Choose the answer which best describes each of the following:

(a) You and a friend decide to have lunch at a rather popular Berkeley resturant. Since
there is a long line at the service counter, each group of people entering the restaurant
decide to have someone grab a table while someone else waits in the line to order the food.
This sounds like a good idea, so your friend sits down at the last free table while you get in
line. Unfortunately, the resturant stops taking orders when there are no tables available,
and you have to wait in line for the people ahead of you. This is an example of

incorrect answer
deadlock   <---------------------------------------------- (a)
inefficency (too much serialization)
unfairness
none of the above (correct parallelism)


(b) After you finally get to eat lunch, you and your friend decide to go to the library to
work on a joint paper. The library has a policy that students who enter the library must
open their backpacks to show that they are not bringing food into the library. They have
several employees doing backpack inspection, so there are several lines for people waiting
to be inspected. However, today there was a bomb threat, and so the inspectors also use a
handheld metal detector to examine the backpacks. Although there are several inspectors,
the library only has one metal detector. This is an example of

incorrect answer
deadlock
inefficency (too much serialization) <-------------  (b)
unfairness
none of the above (correct parallelism)


(c) While you are working on the paper, your friend decides to do some research for your
paper and leaves for a few hours while you continue writing. This is an example of

incorrect answer
deadlock
inefficency (too much serialization)
unfairness
none of the above (correct parallelism)  <------------------ (c)

#| To work on this project, you must load these files into Scheme in the
correct order: obj.scm first, then adv.scm and tables.scm when you're using
that, and finally the particular world you're using, either adv-world.scm or
small-world.scm.  The work you are asked to do refers to adv-world.scm;
small-world.scm is provided in case you'd prefer to debug some of your
procedures in a smaller world that may be less complicated to remember and
also faster to load. |#

(load "obj.scm")
(load "adv.scm")
(load "tables.scm")
;(load "small-world.scm")
(load "adv-world.scm")
(load "part1_person_A.scm")
(load "part1_person_B.scm")
(load "part2_person_A.scm")
(load "part2_person_B.scm")


; to run the project do (load "start-here.scm") in terminal in this folder. Type scheme when prompted by program.
; Most parts are implemented and tested as close in the project instruction texts as possible in part1-part2-files.
; Instead of transcripts ,tests is provided.

#| This is a two-week project.  Each week, your group should
hand in one paper (not one per person) including a listing of your modified
adv.scm program with the modifications highlighted, and a transcript of the
testing of your work.  Indicate on the paper which of you is person A and
which is person B. |#
